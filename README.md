# Human_Emotion_Detection
This is my new project called "HUMAN EMOTION DETECTION". It also detect 4 basic human emotions such as smile, sad, fear, neutral and it says which face is detected. This model is trained with the help of "yolo_V3" algorithm, which is an object detection algorithm. Text to speech conversion is carried out with the help of "pyttsx3" library.
